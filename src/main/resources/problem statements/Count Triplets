You are given an array and you need to find number of tripets of indices (i, j, k) such that the elements at those indices are in geometric progression for a given common ratio r and i < j < k .

Function Description

Complete the countTriplets function in the editor below. It should return the number of triplets forming a geometric progression for a given

as an integer.

countTriplets has the following parameter(s):

    arr: an array of integers
    r: an integer, the common ratio

Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers n and r, the size of arr and the common ratio.
The next line contains n space-seperated integers arr[i] .

Constraints

  1 <= n <= 10^5
  1 <= r <= 10^9
  1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9

Output Format

Return the count of triplets that form a geometric progression
